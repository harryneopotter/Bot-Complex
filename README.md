# Bot-Complex: The Residents

![Bot Complex Home](assets/bot-complex-home.jpg)

## Overview
Bot-Complex is a playful AI "apartment building" where each bot ("resident") occupies an apartment (card) and greets a visiting guest (the user). This project is character-first, ensemble AI funâ€”think sitcom, not productivity suite. All 21 residents are available from day one, each with a unique persona, voice, and specialty.

---

## Features
- **21 Unique AI Residents:** Each with strong voice, constraints, and few-shot examples.
- **Delightful Interactions:** Short, funny, surprising responses; minimal friction.
- **Consistent Persona Experience:** Each resident maintains format and tone across prompts.
- **Transparent AI:** Provider/model surfaced in-stream; ephemeral session memory only.
- **Single-Origin Deploy:** Both frontend and backend served from port 8080 for easy deployment.
