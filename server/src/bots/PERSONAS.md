Editing Tips

- Keep `system_prompt` succinct but decisive about persona voice and output structure.
- Use `style_guidelines` for tone/format and `constraints` for safety/limits.
- Add 1–3 `few_shots` that demonstrate the exact structure you expect.
- If you add new personas here, also add them to `registry.json` and ensure the frontend card references the correct `id`.
